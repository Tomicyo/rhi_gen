# sappheiros

**Sappheiros** is a 3D library trying to find intersections among **Vulkan, Metal and D3D12** which was originally inspired by Google's [`nxt-standalone`](https://github.com/google/nxt-standalone) project.


Sappheiros also has protyping api examples which was built on project [`Kaleido3D`](https://github.com/TsinStudio/kaleido3d),
but the definition of the Api interface was more intuitive and C-friendly in this project.

> PS: This project includes a V8-JS binding generator and test cases.
> It's a MIT licensed project, have fun playing next generation 3D applications with Sappheiros ^_^.
